==============

Calculate the right light temparature according to time of day

Set the light temperature of a hue light acccording to time of day.

I made this to put a hue behind my computer monitor for a plesant ambient light.

please note: 
At the moment I have hardcoded this to connnect to my hue ip and the light I use, so you need to change this, to make it work for you.
